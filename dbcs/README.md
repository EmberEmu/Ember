The DBCs contained in this folder are server-side templates, intended to be filled with your own data. There are no client DBC files here.

To work with these DBC templates, you should use a tool such as [MyDBCEditor](http://modcraft.superparanoid.de/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=782), taking care to remove the dummy record before using the file. The dummy record exists to prevent various DBC tools from crashing or preventing editing when no records are present.

The definitions of these DBCs can be found in the 'dbcs/definitions' directory. Documentation on the purpose of each DBC can be found in the 'docs' directory.
